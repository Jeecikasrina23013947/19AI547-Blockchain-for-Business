# Experiment 2: Blockchain-Based Crowdfunding (Kickstarter Alternative)
DATE:16.04.2025
## Aim:
To create a decentralized crowdfunding platform where donors contribute funds only if the campaign goal is met.

## Algorithm:
### Step 1:
Deploy a smart contract where the project owner sets the funding goal and deadline.

### Step 2:
Define campaign details: project owner address, funding goal, deadline, total contributions, and contributors.

### Step 3:
Contributors send ETH to the campaign, and their contribution is recorded in the contract.

### Step 4:
The smart contract tracks the total ETH raised for the campaign.

### Step 5:
After each contribution, check if the funding goal is met before the deadline.

### Step 6:
If the goal is met before the deadline, release funds to the project owner. If the goal isnâ€™t met before the deadline, allow contributors to withdraw their funds.

### Step 7:
Contributors can withdraw their funds if the goal was not met.

### Step 8:
Once the deadline passes, the campaign ends, and either funds are released to the owner or refunded to contributors.

Users can contribute ETH to the campaign.


If the goal is met, the creator can withdraw funds.


If the goal is not met, contributors can claim a refund.


# High-Level Overview:
Teaches decentralized fundraising.


Avoids fraud by ensuring funds are only transferred if the goal is met.

# RESULT: 
Thus the experiment successfully executed.
